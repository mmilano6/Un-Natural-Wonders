the final install at Ars Electronica

</br>

Recently I had the opportunity to present my piece at the AAAI Spring 2018 symposium in the UX for AI section. This really provided a much needed time to revisit and reflect on the project after showing it at Ars Electronica. 
</br></br>

</br>


For me this piece revealed a few ideas. First is that we should design humans back into the role of automation, which became the focus of my thesis. Another is if the ethical treatment of artificial intelligence is not taken into consideration at the outset, the repercussions could become significant when creating future iterations of artificial intelligence. This includes making ethical decisions when creating algorithms, and how we go about making them. I think we are in an interesting position currently, where we can further curate and design our training sets, more so then we have even been able to. and being able to do so allows us to further make decisions and control how these algorithms interact with users. Lastly I think we need to to create user experience for artificial intelligence. But I’m not sure if user experience is exactly the right term, at least I’ve had a hard time thinking of it that way maybe we need a new term for what user experience for artificial intelligence is seeing it doesn’t have emotion and because in the end it will affect how we interact with the algorithm.

# // A closer look at the project

</br>

I want to make it clear I’m not suggesting sentience. I am saying if a device were to have a specific function and a choice to keep running would it?

</br>

Artificial intelligence will be implemented more and more into the daily aspects of the labor industry, both in industrial and non-industrial jobs. After all it already is. Industrial jobs are defined as jobs that would normally be described as blue-collar, and non-industrial jobs as ones that would be normally described as white-collar. But as the workforce starts to incorporate artificial intelligence into labor, the definition of “blue -collar” and “white -collar” will change. workers that once did manual tasks, will start working with robots, and will likely have to start to program and fix more engineering-based issues for the device on the floor. Blurring the traditional understanding of what white collar and blue collar jobs are.

</br>
</br>

This change will be similar to how labor changed during the industrial revolution. The change might not be as significant, but it will still represent a significant shift in labor roles. And as this shift happens, artificial intelligence will obviously advance, becoming more intelligent and capable of greater and broader tasks and jobs. Artificial intelligence will also have the ability to adapt and learn in response to external stimuli or even in response to the person interacting with it. This slide depicts an ecosystem of futuristic artificially intelligent devices in the various stages of their lives. It also was used to explore what a smaller scale environment would be like when there is community of devices working with each other or near each other.

A great example of devices reacting and learning from humans is Mimus by Madeline Gannon which sees and interacts with viewers. Mimus will even get bored if the viewer doesn’t interact 
with it enough.

</br>
</br>

With this shift, it’s possible that the algorithm will become more of a co-worker embodied within a device, which also could be seen as a co-worker depending on the relationship the worker has with the device. And with the broader knowledge set and bigger role in the task, the device would develop characteristics of its own. seen in this detail of the previous slide, humans work with their cobots to tend to the farm. This also illustrates more or less what the devices were doing in their working lives.

# // Importance of the park

</br>

If devices and the algorithms they run off of are getting broader knowledge, and have become our colleagues, what happens when we are done using them. Does our use of them determine their lifespan? 

</br>


Do we archive algorithms, so their existence is kept, but in a dormant state? Or do they deserve down time, time do to whatever they want to do. And if so what does that look like? here is the piece installed in the gallery space at Ars Electronica in Linz Austria. Intelligent Devices Retirement Preserve consists of two informational plaques 

</br>


<img width="969" alt="screen shot 2018-04-18 at 11 50 27 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30060990/38951896-d0818160-42fe-11e8-81c5-077839336cb3.png">

</br>
</br>


that detail the presence of devices that you might see while visiting the preserve in Linz. They allow for the viewer to look out the preserve offices windows over Linz, while learning about what they might see in the preserve.This is showing the whole preserve which spans over a large portion of Europe, showing its activity. while informing the viewer where they are in the vast park. 

</br>


<img width="668" alt="screen shot 2018-04-18 at 11 52 20 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30060990/38951958-ff793cce-42fe-11e8-9fd5-8d2c2ff68bcb.png">
</br>


This plaque explores one of my initial interests early in the project about how the devices could have their own boundaries that existed within and over the boundaries that we as people abide by or acknowledge. 

</br>

</br>


In this map of the Linz branch of the preserve, you can read about the different lives the devices live, their retirement status, and what they are doing post retirement. Now I know this is a bit far fetched, but that is very much intentional. by exploring something as extreme as retirement for artificial intelligence and the devices they embody and giving them the ability to choose to find new work, work past their expected work quota or end date, and allowing them to do what they want after that date, further develops what a future relationship between artificially intelligent devices and humans would be like. while going beyond the idea that devices needing humans to exist, helps the viewer to accept and question this new work dynamic between humans and artificially intelligent devices
