the final install at Ars Electronica

Recently I had the opportunity to present my piece at the AAAI Spring 2018 symposium in the UX for AI section. This really provided a much needed time to revisit and reflect on the project after showing it at Ars Electronica.

For me this piece revealed a few ideas. First is that we should design humans back into the role of automation, which became the focus of my thesis. Another is if the ethical treatment of artificial intelligence is not taken into consideration at the outset, the repercussions could become significant when creating future iterations of artificial intelligence. This includes making ethical decisions when creating algorithms, and how we go about making them. I think we are in an interesting position currently, where we can further curate and design our training sets, more so then we have even been able to. and being able to do so allows us to further make decisions and control how these algorithms interact with users. Lastly I think we need to to create user experience for artificial intelligence. But I’m not sure if user experience is exactly the right term, at least I’ve had a hard time thinking of it that way maybe we need a new term for what user experience for artificial intelligence is seeing it doesn’t have emotion and because in the end it will affect how we interact with the algorithm.
