This project consists of two main iterations. The first iteration is Local #362: AI Post Retirements, which led to
Intelligent Devices Retirement Preserve: (un) Natural Wonders. Intelligent Devices Retirement Preserve: (un) Natural Wonders
was exhibited Ars Electronica in 2017.  

Local #362: AI Post Retirements, explores how IoT devices, specifically devices with artificial
intelligence and machine learning, will degrade over time, and their retirement, or lack there of,
in our future neighborhoods. And more specifically how their failure occurs because of the human hand.

Intelligent Devices Retirement Preserve: (un) Natural Wonders explores what life would be like for
artificial intelligence algorithms, and the devices that they embody, if they had a choice to retire
and do whatever they wanted.

Intelligent Devices Retirement Preserve: (un) Natural Wonders was exhibited at Ars Electronica 2017.
