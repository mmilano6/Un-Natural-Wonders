Local #362: AI Post Retirements, explores how IoT devices, specifically devices with artificial intelligence and machine learning, will degrade over time, and their retirement, or lack there of, in our future neighborhoods. And more specifically how their failure occurs because of the human hand. I chose to root my piece the farming community, because of how advance the IoT technology already is. I picked cattle/ dairy farms because of the large spaces they take up. I find the fact that IoT devices being able to communicate over 100's of miles really interesting, espec	ially how it redefines what a neighborhood boundary is. As these devices become more and more common over time their infrastructure will decay.

This piece began with my interest in what retirement would be for AI?/ML devices, and what would they do if they were retired. In addition to this, I was intrigued by what their past life story might be, much like the bar room hero many towns have at the local pub. This person spends much of their time at the pub, but more importantly tends to have a very rich knowledge of the community and the weird things that have happened throughout the years.

I began to sketch out ideas of what this life might be, and what a neighborhood bar for IoT devices might be. While researching the project I realized that farms already use a lot of very sophisticated technology (more than one would assume), which added a new interest to the project, and a bit of a focal point to situate the project in: what would future farm AI devices be? With this in mind I began sketching out possible future farm devices, and creating backstories for them.


As the piece evolved, and I started to explore what the neighborhood bar would be to an IoT farm device, the idea that many local bars and pubs tend to have their own wunderkammer of sorts documenting the history of the neighborhood. Which is what led to this sketch.

Now I’m interested in the geographic locations the devices would have come from.

CCTV_030496

The first senior member is CCTV_030496, it was purchased in a bulk order by the government to keep an eye on various locations that were suspected of illegal operations.

The government wanted to observe the Miller Dairy because they were showing a heightened level of heat from their farm, and their electric usage was a bit high. but they couldn't find the Millers guilty of anything,

out of embarrassment they blamed the outcome on CCTV_030496. But because CCTV_030496 was a government employee/device they couldn't decommission it.

This where Local #362 stepped in to make sure it received the retirement it deserved. CCTV_030496 is available for new employment, however because of its past work it focuses on violations of laws and regulations.

MooTalk™

Next up is MooTalk™ which was purchased by the Garcia’s Dairy to get a better idea of what their herd was thinking about. They figured happier cattle, the better their product would be.

MooTalk™ was an experimental wearable that specialized in Moo to Text artificial intelligence. The device translated cow communications and sent them to a email account for the owner to read and decide if any actions needed to be taken.

Studies were promising, but the company went to market to soon, and MooTalk™ ended up being a big failure. It isn't a completely useless device, after all it translates what cows were thinking very accurately… but that was just the problem. The Garcia’s cattle were extremely intelligent, but were always complaining about the boredom of day to day life. Their email account would run out of space every day or so with complaints about how the sun wasn't just right or how one cow took the other cows grazing spot.

After a year and a few months of dealing with the constant bickering the Garcia’s had enough, and decided to retire MooTalk™, and upgrade to a newer system that didn't result in so many complaints. Between the complaints and because theres no one doing maintenance on the device the Garcia retired MooTalk.

MooTalk™ is available for new employment, however knowledge of training deep learning neural networks is needed.


Give MooTalk™ a new role on your farm or work place, email local.ai.362@gmail.com for employment inquires.



Box Unloader

Box Unloader started working with a crew unloading cargo on the docks, but after many years of working it became a bit weaker then was relieved of its duties. Box Unloader was then retired, but was quickly bought up by Patel Dairy to help with lighter loads.

The Patel’s had a bit of a hard time because in order to do maintenance on Box Unloader they had to contact the original company that built it, but instead they found someone in the community that had written a software patch that allowed them service it on their own.

This went on for many years, but they got to the point where they were ready to upgrade. Box Unloader was showing its age, it had plenty of wear and tear, and furthermore they needed a cobot that could handle heavier loads.

But there was one problem, they couldn't sell Box Unloader to anyone because they had hacked the software, and they didn't want to get in trouble for it. So like many great working devices it was retired to Local #362. Box unloader is available for new employment. Box Unloader is still trained on moving loads, just not the very heavy loads.

Give Box Unloader a new role on your farm or work place, email local.ai.362@gmail.com for employment inquires.

HappyBlimp™

But our premiere device is HappyBlimp™ was purchased by the O’Toole’s Dairy to watch over the herd and make sure nothing bad or out of the ordinary happened. But over time its machine vision started to deteriorate, and it began to see a warped view of the world. Overall HappyBlimp™’s machine vision still works, but the added hallucinations were unnerving to the owners son, who occasionally assisted on the dairy.

The owner of the diary had no choice, but to bring it to Local #362 for retirement. HappyBlimp™ is available for new employment, however because of its past work it has the tendency to hallucinate images full of small dog faces.

Please take a look at the great job HappyBlimp is capable of. (invite people to come look at tablet and blimpy)

Give HappyBlimp™ a new role on your farm or work place, email local.ai.362@gmail.com for employment inquires.

// Process

I started this piece with surprisingly broad ideas, and the outcome, as it always is, was not great. But one of the general questions, What happens when AI maintaining the efficiency of a building/infrastructure fails? Led me to the question of, what would be retirement for an AI network. So I began researching retirement, and I found a lot of similar lists about planning for retirement, and all of them had questions like this:

Acclimate before you relocate.
2) Get to know the characters.
3) Check out the medical care.
4) Factor in local tax rates.
5) …..

These were a great start, and part of me looking back thinks I should have used these lists to root the project in reality, but at the time this felt like it was just scratching the surface. I needed a specific location to frame the complex social interaction of what retirement would be for an AI network. This is where my earlier idea of the bar room hero came in. The Bar room hero tends to be someone that is in a way retired and spends most of their day at their local neighborhood bar drinking. Even though this isn’t the brightest and happiest place to spend your retirement, these people tend to be a local historian and gossip. I felt that it was a great metaphor for a device that would have a lifetime's knowledge on one task or area. About this time I started to realize that along with retirement it is really interesting what the lifestory of a device was. What knowledge would they have from their past lives. I began trying to use the bar framework to explore these questions. Many of these bars have collections of random objects/ memorabilia of the neighborhood, which made me think of a wunderkammer. I began exploring how the wunderkammer could be the bar for retired AI/ML devices. But as the piece progressed more and more people had a hard time understanding the bar aspect of the project (apparently the neighborhood bar is not so universal)





Luckily while I was researching bars and the social dynamics of them, I was also looking at what a local neighborhood would look like for these devices. My research on bars and even restaurants wasn’t turning up much about how IoT or AI/ML was being implemented, but this lead to a really interesting aspect of devices on farms. Surprisingly farming uses a lot of IoT already and is constantly moving towards using more and more sophisticated systems. So I shifted gears, and moved my focus away from bars to farming, specifically dairy farming. In addition to dairy farms, I wanted to explore how IoT and AI/ML would reshape what regions, towns, and neighborhoods would be. Because they could cover/ communicate over large areas, things like state lines and other human boundaries would not matter, and how they be redefined. At this point I decided I needed to look back at what I had and look for a common theme. I began thinking about how all of the devices memories would be of aspects of work, and how in the future it would be likely, or at least interesting, that AI/ML devices would have a union that would represent them (this was also somewhat in response to Bill Gates proposed tax on robots).










At this point I was nearing the deadline and needed to bring all of these details together, and was having a bit of a hard time. I knew I wanted to make something tangible, mostly because all of my previous work has been on screen, and I felt i needed to break away from that. So I began by trying to use the tinyTile to do something, but I didn't have the time to figure out the technical parts of that, and had to start making HappyBlimp™ and wizard of Oz’ing its playback function. I created a video clip of past memories it would have had on the farm while it was doing surveillance of the cattle, but because it was starting to get old and hallucinate more, I ran all the clips through Google's Deep Dream algorithms, and incorporated the hallucinated footage. In addition to being able to interact with HappyBlimp™, I turned my instal space into a mock union hall where the visitors (the audience) could come and bid and buy old devices to keep them from being decommissioned.





Presentation intro

Hi welcome to Local #362 union hall, its an amazing day here in Wyoming.

hand out sales card.

Local #362 is here to serve its regional AI devices in making sure that previous employers provide them the retirement that they legally deserve. This local hall provides the proper space for them to spend their legally provided 5 year retirement period before they are decommissioned, and used for parts, or fully decommissioned. Its our duty to allow these devices the opportunity to work as much of their lifespan as possible, regardless of deterioration or defects from previous jobs, before being decommissioned.

Today I will be introducing you to a few of our senior union members, these are members that are approaching they’re 5th year of retirement.

If you are interested in re-employing a device please contact:

// Critical Reflection

This project ended too early… I feel like it has a lot of interesting topics and a great foundation, but in the end I wasn't really able to bring all the information and initial sketches together to make something that pushed it farther. From the start this began to be a problem by addressing what retirement would be for an AI network, especially while trying to keep it from being a very dystopic outcome. Currently it seems AI/ML network and devices are run non stop until they break, but that was the obvious. Trying to move past that, and speculate if the devices were to receive some form downtime or some form of humanhood, while not making them sentient, was difficult. In addition to avoiding the idea of sentient, something I don’t think will happen, was trying to not make the project touch on a lifespan that consisted completely of being worked to death. Then beyond that was the issue of justifying why the devices would get downtime, and what downtime would be.

Even though I feel like this piece should have been more than a half larping, half presentation, introducing people to the union hall and the HappyBlimp™ console, I feel like it unveiled a wealth of starting points for future explorations and pieces. More importantly it made me realize that I’m interesting in several specific areas: IoT and AI/ML over large geographical location, industrial labor, and how AI/ML can act as augmentation and as an extension of the human worker. This piece really has informed me on what my thesis focus is, and given me direction on what I should be doing this summer. I plan on using this foundation to do several pieces over the summer, one of which will be experimenting with Raspberry Pi and potentially long distances. It has also informed my current piece, which uses gestural controls taught to a neural network to control a small robot. After finishing this project I realized that I had only been thinking of the possible ways AI/ML would act as an extension of the human worker, but I had never tested it. So with my current piece I decided to make one of the devices from an earlier piece, Intermediary Transcendence Proxy, and see how it would function as an extension of my hand.
